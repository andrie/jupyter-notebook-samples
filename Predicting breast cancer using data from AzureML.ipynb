The data residdes in the Azure Machine Learning Studio, and this example download the data to the notebook and then fits a simple regression model. The `AzureML` package allows you to import datasets from the AzureML-Studio to your local R session, or indeed a notebook.\n",

    "The `Breast cancer data` is one of three cancer-related datasets provided by the Oncology Institute that appears frequently in machine learning literature. Combines diagnostic information with features from laboratory analysis of about 300 tissue samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: Classify the type of cancer, based on 9 attributes, some of which are linear and some are categorical.\n",
