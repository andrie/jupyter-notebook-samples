    "# How to publish a web service to Azure ML using R\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to use Jupyter notebooks on the Azure Machine Learning (ML) platform to develope a model in R and publish a web service based on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Azure ML R notebooks\n",
    "The answer to this question depends on how much you know about Azure ML. For data scientists who're new to Azure ML and accustomed to doing all analytical work using R on local computers,  Azure Machine Learning makes it possible to write R notebooks on the cloud. So anyone with internet access can work with R from a web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you use R and understand the basics of Azure ML, Azure ML's R notebooks make it possible to develope your models in R and then operationalize them easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "For data scientists who're comfortable with both R and Azure ML Experiments, R notebooks can be used together with Azure ML Experiments in different ways:\n",
    "  * To explore data from Azure Machine Learning Experiment. For example, you can use R notebook to visualize your data in different ways.\n",
    "  * To fit models and use techniques that are not available in Azure ML Experiments yet. For example, R offers more options in terms of variable selection techniques and a wider variety of GBM models. You can also used it for time series analysis.\n",
    "  * To test code before they are used in the \"Execute R Script\" module of Azure ML Experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target audience\n",
    "The target audience of this notebook are R users who have a basic understanding of Azure ML. If you are new to Azure ML, Section 2 of the [Data Scientists' Guide][guide link] provides enough information for you to follow this tutorial. \n",

    "## Data\n",
    "In this example, we'll use the housing data from the R package `MASS`.  The Boston data contains 506 rows and 14 columns. Available information includes median home price, average number of rooms per dwelling, crime rate by town, etc. Find more information about this dataset by running `?Boston` in an R terminal."
